                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <a>The easiest guy, who was born on January 10, 2006. At the age of 4.5 he went to preparatory class in a Ukrainian school, at the age of 14 he graduated, after which he immediately went to college in the city of Zaporozhye, Aviation. Since the first year I was interested in programming and got involved in it, learning more and more languages, trying to understand what I want from life, what to do and what to be. I started my way with Java, or to be more precise, by writing modifications for the game Minecraft. I liked it, after that I already pumped my skills, knowledge of the language, syntax and oop, and went into something deeper, and gained knowledge of many things. Class transformation, reflection, and all that stuff. I realized one thing from life: I only want to do something global, which will prove to me that I'm worth something :)</a>
